## Windows building
All relevant libraries are found in /libs and all DLLs found in /dlls (pre-)compiled for Windows. 
The CMake script knows where to find the libraries so just run CMake script and generate project of choice.
Note that you still have to manually copy the required .DLL files from the /dlls folder to your binary folder for the binaries to run.

Keep in mind the supplied libraries were generated with a specific compiler version which may or may not work on your system (generating a
large batch of link errors). In that case it's advised to build the libraries yourself from the source.
